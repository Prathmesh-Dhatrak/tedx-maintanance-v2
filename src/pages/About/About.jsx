              TED is a non-profit organisation devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. 
              It started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, 
              believing passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, 
              and lives and welcoming people from every discipline and culture who 
              seek a deeper understanding of the world. Today, the two annual 
              TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less and the total events conducted till now are more than 6000. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com in more than a 100 languages.

                {" "}
                This has led to a global community focused on change through the power of ideas, 
                thus forming a trinity of ideas from- Technology, Entertainment, and Design, 
                and has recently taken up a broader scope ranging from science and business to 
                global issues in more than a 100 languages.

            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a TED-created program of local,
             self-organised events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. 
             These events are open-source and local-community driven organised by passionate
              individuals who seek to uncover new ideas and share the latest research in their
               local areas that spark conversations in their communities and ultimately elevate 
               them to a global stage. TEDx events aim to integrate ideas from every nook and 
               corner of the world, thus, extending the boundaries of views and ideas.

            Our event is named TEDxVITPune, where x= independently organised TED event. 
            The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual

            <br/>
            We, here at TEDxVITPune, believe that the simplest of ideas uphold the ability to 
            change the world entirely. Such captivating ideas encourage, inspire and hold the 
            power to bring individuals together and bridge the gaps between communities. 

            </p>
            <p>
            The preeminent purpose of all our events, social media campaigns, and community 
            newsletters is to put together, exchange and brainstorm ground-breaking ideas. 
            Ideas that originate from different minds, different ideologies, and paramountly, 
            different beings.

            Our community forms the heart and soul of TEDx. Be it the power echoed by the unification of different minds, or the warmth experienced owing to a feeling of togetherness.
